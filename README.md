# Futbol Team Creater

## Project Goal

The goal was to create a simple and fast single page web app that allows a user to randomly create two teams for pickup games of soccer.

## Functionality

The UI was built using React.js for its quick ability to render players and teams.  A user can 
add up to 24 players in a player pool.

By selecting the generate button, two teams are randomly generated using the Fisher-Yates Shuffle method.  When there is an odd number of players, a free agent will be randomly created.

## Thoughts:
This quick app was designed to be simple and served as a learning experience for using React.js.

## Update:
Future updates include being able to preselect amount of players per team, adding special category and UI for substitutes, creating player-jerseys using CSS, being able to save teams.
